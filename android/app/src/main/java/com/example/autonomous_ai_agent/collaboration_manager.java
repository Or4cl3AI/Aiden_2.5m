Here is the code for the file `android/app/src/main/java/com/example/autonomous_ai_agent/collaboration_manager.java`:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CollaborationManager {
    private List<AutonomousAIAgent> agents;

    public CollaborationManager() {
        agents = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addAgent(AutonomousAIAgent agent) {
        agents.add(agent);
    }

    public void removeAgent(AutonomousAIAgent agent) {
        agents.remove(agent);
    }

    public void collaborate() {
        for (AutonomousAIAgent agent : agents) {
            agent.executeTask();
        }
    }
}
```

This code defines the `CollaborationManager` class, which is responsible for managing the collaboration between the autonomous AI agents. It maintains a list of `AutonomousAIAgent` objects and provides methods to add and remove agents from the list. The `collaborate()` method iterates over the agents and calls their `executeTask()` method.

Please note that this code assumes the existence of the `AutonomousAIAgent` class, which is one of the shared dependencies. The implementation of the `AutonomousAIAgent` class is not provided here as it is generated separately.

Remember to include this code in the appropriate file and make sure to include the necessary imports.
