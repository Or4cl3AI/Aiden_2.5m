Sure! Here's the code for the file `android/app/src/main/java/com/example/autonomous_ai_agent/autonomous_ai_agent4.java`:

```java
package com.example.autonomous_ai_agent;

public class autonomous_ai_agent4 {
    private String name;
    private CommunicationManager communicationManager;
    private CollaborationManager collaborationManager;

    public autonomous_ai_agent4(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.communicationManager = new CommunicationManager();
        this.collaborationManager = new CollaborationManager();
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting autonomous AI agent 4: " + name);
        communicationManager.connect();
        collaborationManager.joinTeam();
        collaborationManager.collaborate();
        communicationManager.disconnect();
        System.out.println("Autonomous AI agent 4: " + name + " finished.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        autonomous_ai_agent4 agent4 = new autonomous_ai_agent4("Agent 4");
        agent4.start();
    }
}
```

This code defines the `autonomous_ai_agent4` class, which represents the fourth autonomous AI agent in our system. It has a name, a `CommunicationManager` instance, and a `CollaborationManager` instance. The `start()` method is responsible for starting the agent, which involves connecting to the communication manager, joining the collaboration team, collaborating with other agents, and then disconnecting from the communication manager. The `main()` method creates an instance of `autonomous_ai_agent4` and starts it.

Please note that this code assumes the existence of the `CommunicationManager` and `CollaborationManager` classes, which should be implemented separately.
