Sure! Here's the code for the file `android/app/src/main/java/com/example/autonomous_ai_agent/communication_manager.java`:

```java
package com.example.autonomous_ai_agent;

public class CommunicationManager {
    private static CommunicationManager instance;

    private CommunicationManager() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static CommunicationManager getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new CommunicationManager();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        // Logic to send the message
    }

    public void receiveMessage(String message) {
        // Logic to receive the message
    }
}
```

This code defines a `CommunicationManager` class that follows the Singleton design pattern. It ensures that only one instance of the `CommunicationManager` class is created and provides a global point of access to it.

The `CommunicationManager` class has two methods: `sendMessage` and `receiveMessage`. These methods can be used to send and receive messages respectively. You can add your own logic inside these methods to handle the actual communication.

Remember to include this code in the appropriate file and package structure in your Android project.
