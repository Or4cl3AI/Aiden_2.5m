Sure! Here's the code for the file `android/app/src/main/java/com/example/autonomous_ai_agent/autonomous_ai_agent1.java`:

```java
package com.example.autonomous_ai_agent;

public class autonomous_ai_agent1 {
    private String name;
    private CommunicationManager communicationManager;

    public autonomous_ai_agent1(String name, CommunicationManager communicationManager) {
        this.name = name;
        this.communicationManager = communicationManager;
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting autonomous AI agent 1: " + name);
        communicationManager.sendMessage("Hello from autonomous AI agent 1!");
    }

    public void receiveMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println("Received message in autonomous AI agent 1: " + message);
    }
}
```

This code defines the `autonomous_ai_agent1` class, which represents one of the autonomous AI agents in our app. It has a `name` property and a `communicationManager` object for sending and receiving messages. The `start` method prints a message and sends a greeting message using the `communicationManager`. The `receiveMessage` method prints the received message.

Please note that this code assumes the existence of the `CommunicationManager` class, which is one of the shared dependencies. Make sure to generate the code for that class as well.
