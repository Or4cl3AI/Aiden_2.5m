Sure! Here's the code for the `ruby_on_rails/deploy_manager.rb` file:

```ruby
require_relative 'autonomous_ai_agent'

class DeployManager
  def initialize
    @agents = []
  end

  def add_agent(agent)
    @agents << agent
  end

  def deploy_agents
    @agents.each do |agent|
      agent.deploy
    end
  end
end
```

This code defines a `DeployManager` class that is responsible for deploying the autonomous AI agents. It has an `initialize` method that initializes an empty array to store the agents. The `add_agent` method allows adding an agent to the array. The `deploy_agents` method iterates over the agents and calls their `deploy` method.

Please note that this code assumes the existence of the `AutonomousAIAgent` class, which should be defined in the `autonomous_ai_agent.rb` file.
